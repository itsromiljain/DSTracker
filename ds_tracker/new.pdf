     Project Description
 The approach for impact-based analysis is to identify the config files (plists) consumed by the APU workflow services. To identify the plists the service browser page can be used to run a service and in the debug page, the plists consumed by the service gets published.
The published information can be used to create the mapping document between the service and plists. The user has to provide the start & end Commit Ids to identify the plists modified/added/deleted in the config repositories for APU services. The change in plist file names can be compared with the plist file names in the mapping document. If the plists are modified in the mapping document, then corresponding test suites that need to be run will be marked. The execution can then be triggered manually or through existing jobs in Jenkins.
       Role & Contribution
  • Developed restful services using spring boot.
• Written code for getting list of Plist files changed between two
commit id’s using bitbucket API.
• Developed Jenkins job Using Jenkins API.
• Integrated Tomcat 8.5 to run our developed restful webservices.
• Involved in review of the functions and scripts developed by other
team members.
• Integrating rest service through jQuery Ajax call. Bootstrap for
responsive UI
• Involved in project structure. Involved in Configuration and in
Build.
• Used LDAP directory server and postures database for offline
activities
